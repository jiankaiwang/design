# Project Management



In unity, a project means the collection of all necessary resources, such like 3D objects, scenes, textures, scripts, etc. It is also easy to export the whole or the partial project for distributing. 



## Create a New Project



* Click `File`, `New Project` on the toolbar. 
* Type `Project name`, choose `Location`, select additional asset packages on `Add Asset Package` if necessary, and click `Create project`. 



## Open a Project



* Click `File`, `Open Project` on the toolbar.
* Choose the project what you want to open.
* If you upgrade unity or open a old version project from a relatively new version unity environemt, message `Upgrading project` would exist to notify you to upgrade the project. You can't open the project on the old unity after you upgrade it.



## Save a Project



* Click `File`, `Save Project` on the toolbar to save all changes you made to the project.



## Create a Scene



* Click `File`, `New Scene` on the toolbar to create a new scene. There are often multiple scenes to change during a game for different levels or stories. Each scene has its own selection menu, beginning or ending animation, etc.
* You can also create a new scene by right-clicking the current sence on hierarchy view, and then choose `Add New Sence`.



## Open a Scene



* Click `File`, `Open Sence` on the toolbar and choose the sence (e.g. sence1.unity).



## Save a Scene



* Click `File`, `Save Sences` (or `Save Sences as` to save as another sence) on the toolbar and select the location where you want to save.
* Notice that the sence must be saved on the folder `Asset`, otherwise, the wrong message arises.



## Build a Project



* Click `File`, `Build Settings` on the toolbar, and you can build the project on different platforms.



## Run a Project



* If you connect the device to the computer and its driver is also well installed, you can build and run the project on it by clicking `File`, `Build & Run` (or you can click `File`, `Build Settings`, and `Build` to export a packaged file) on the toolbar. 



## Package a Project



* It is easy to package the project resource for distributing it. On `Porject View` right-click on the folder (e.g. Asset) which you want to export, choose `Export Package`, select the resource, and `Export` a `.unitypackage` file.



## FIle Management



As the game developing proceeds, it is common to import or edit lots of different resources. In order to effectively manage the whole resource, designers usually create different folders to classify it, for example,  `Animations`, `Fonts`, `Materials`, `Object`, `PhysicalMaterials`, `Prefabs`, `Scenes`, `Scripts`, `Shaders`, `Sound`, `Textures`, etc.
