# GameObject / Prefab



Prefab (Prefabricated) is a type of resources and is used in repeated objects, e.g. enemy, weapon, car, etc. You can create a origin object and transform it into a prefab resource. if it is needed to repeat generating objects, you can add the copy of prefab, called a `instance`, into the game scene. You can also add the prefab into different projects. (The prefab is similar with class-object relation in the object-oriented programming.)



The instance is related with the prefab. If the prefab is changed, the instance is also changed. That is the useful feature if you create lots of instances and you need to modify all of them.
